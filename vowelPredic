# # You should have a file named data_only_alpha.pkl in your working directory
# # This is a pickle file, you can load it with this command:

import pickle
with open("data_only_alpha.pkl", "rb") as f:
    data_only_alpha = pickle.load(f)

# The file is a list of 20000 sentences with no punctuation and no numbers, only ascii alphanumeric characters
# Your task is to create a model to predict whether the next character in a given input is going to be a consonant or a vowel.
# You can assume that your input does not contain numbers, it contains only ascii alphanumeric characters and spaces
# You can consider a space as a vowel
# The minimum length of the input to your model will be 10 characters
# You have 20000 sentences taken from wikipedia and cleaned up that you can use to train and test your model
